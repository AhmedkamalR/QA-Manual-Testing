# 📡 API Testing Checklist

This checklist ensures **comprehensive testing coverage** of **API services** across Web, Mobile, and 3rd-party integrations.  
It includes **functional, security, performance, integration, and edge case checks** to validate that APIs are reliable, secure, and scalable.  

---

## ✅ Functional Testing
- [ ] Verify all endpoints are implemented as per API specification.  
- [ ] Validate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are correct per endpoint.  
- [ ] Check required request parameters and headers.  
- [ ] Validate optional parameters are handled correctly.  
- [ ] Ensure correct status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500).  
- [ ] Verify success response body matches schema.  
- [ ] Verify error response body matches schema.  
- [ ] Validate pagination (limit, offset, page).  
- [ ] Check sorting and filtering work correctly.  
- [ ] Validate CRUD operations end-to-end.  
- [ ] Verify authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth, API key).  
- [ ] Ensure logout / token revocation works properly.  
- [ ] Validate input data type handling (int, float, string, boolean).  

---

## 🔒 Security Testing
- [ ] Ensure API is accessible only via HTTPS.  
- [ ] Verify sensitive data (passwords, tokens) are never exposed in responses.  
- [ ] Check rate limiting and brute force protection.  
- [ ] Validate SQL Injection protection.  
- [ ] Validate XSS protection in input fields.  
- [ ] Verify access control (user cannot access another user’s data).  
- [ ] Test expired / tampered tokens.  
- [ ] Validate CORS policies.  
- [ ] Ensure error messages do not leak stack traces.  

---

## ⚡ Performance & Load Testing
- [ ] Measure response time for each endpoint under normal load.  
- [ ] Stress test with high number of requests (e.g., 1000 req/sec).  
- [ ] Validate API behavior under peak load.  
- [ ] Verify system recovers gracefully after stress.  
- [ ] Test concurrent requests (multi-user scenarios).  
- [ ] Validate caching behavior (ETags, Cache-Control headers).  
- [ ] Verify DB queries are optimized (no slow endpoints).  

---

## 🌐 Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify API integration with frontend (Web, Mobile).  
- [ ] Validate 3rd party integrations (payment gateway, shipping).  
- [ ] Ensure webhook callbacks are received and processed.  
- [ ] Test compatibility with different client SDKs.  
- [ ] Validate API versioning (v1, v2).  

---

## 🧪 Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Send empty request body.  
- [ ] Send malformed JSON body.  
- [ ] Very large request payload (>1MB).  
- [ ] Missing headers (e.g., Content-Type).  
- [ ] Invalid content type (text/xml instead of application/json).  
- [ ] Test boundary values for numeric parameters.  
- [ ] Test UTF-8 characters, emojis in inputs.  
- [ ] Simulate network instability (timeouts, retries).  
- [ ] Validate behavior when dependent service is down (DB, 3rd party).  

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Verify API logs all requests & errors.  
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not logged.  
- [ ] Validate health check endpoints (`/status`, `/health`).  
- [ ] Verify API monitoring (metrics, uptime).  
- [ ] Check alerting is configured for failures.  

---

## 📌 Final Review
- [ ] All endpoints tested against documentation.  
- [ ] Positive, negative, and edge cases covered.  
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities validated.  
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved.  
- [ ] Integration with frontend and external systems verified.
