# 🔁 Regression Testing Checklist

This checklist helps structure regression cycles: what to run, how to prioritize, automation practices, environment & data needs, and ways to keep regression suites healthy and effective.

---

## ✅ Regression Scope & Selection
- [ ] Maintain a list of **critical flows** (login, checkout, payment, search, order history).  
- [ ] Identify modules changed in the release and include their dependent flows.  
- [ ] Include all bugs fixed in the release for targeted regression.  
- [ ] Add previously flaky areas or high-risk code paths.  
- [ ] Periodically review and prune obsolete test cases.

## ⚖️ Prioritization & Risk-Based Selection
- [ ] Prioritize test cases by business impact and likelihood of regression.  
- [ ] Group test cases into: smoke (must run), core regression (high priority), extended regression (when time allows).  
- [ ] Use risk assessment to decide what to run for hotfixes vs full releases.

## 🤖 Automation Strategy
- [ ] Automate stable, repeatable test cases (smoke & core regression).  
- [ ] Keep UI automation focused on end-to-end smoke & critical flows; prefer API automation for logic checks.  
- [ ] Ensure automated tests are idempotent and environment-independent.  
- [ ] Integrate automated regression into CI pipeline for nightly or pre-release runs.  
- [ ] Tag/label tests for easy grouping (smoke, payment, search, mobile).

## 🧪 Manual Regression Execution
- [ ] Have clear test runs for manual QA when automation not available.  
- [ ] Use regression checklists for manual cycles (critical flows first).  
- [ ] Ensure testers have required test data and accounts ready.

## 🧰 Test Data & Environment
- [ ] Use a stable staging environment that mirrors production.  
- [ ] Keep test data refresh procedures documented; use snapshots for repeatable runs.  
- [ ] Ensure payment gateways and third-party integrations are in sandbox/mock mode.

## 📈 Flakiness & Maintenance
- [ ] Track flaky tests and quarantine until stabilized.  
- [ ] Maintain an SLA for fixing flaky automated tests (e.g., 2 sprints).  
- [ ] Regularly refactor and update automated suites to reduce maintenance overhead.

## 🧾 Reporting & Exit Criteria
- [ ] Report pass/fail rates and test coverage after each regression run.  
- [ ] Exit when: all P1/P2 defects fixed and re-tested, critical smoke passed.  
- [ ] Maintain a regression run log with environment, build, and test results.

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Review regression suite after each release; add test cases for missed bugs.  
- [ ] Use defect root cause analysis to cover new regression areas.  
- [ ] Track automation ROI (time saved vs maintenance cost).

## 📌 Value
A disciplined regression process guarantees that new changes don't break existing behavior — crucial to avoid regressions in revenue-critical e-commerce flows.
