## üì± Device & OS Compatibility
- [ ] Test on multiple Android versions (latest + previous 2 major releases).  
- [ ] Test on multiple iOS versions (latest + previous 1 major release).  
- [ ] Validate app behavior on different manufacturers (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, iPhone, iPad).  
- [ ] Verify portrait and landscape orientations.  
- [ ] Check responsiveness on small, medium, and large screens.  
- [ ] Test on devices with different RAM/CPU capabilities.  
- [ ] Verify app behavior when switching between apps (background/foreground).  
- [ ] Confirm app resumes correctly after a phone call or notification.  

---

## üåê Network Testing
- [ ] Validate app behavior on **Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G, and offline mode**.  
- [ ] Test switching from Wi-Fi to mobile data during transactions.  
- [ ] Simulate slow network (2G/3G throttling).  
- [ ] Confirm app resumes after network loss.  
- [ ] Verify API calls are retried/recovered after timeouts.  
- [ ] Ensure caching works when offline and syncs when online.  

---

## üîí Security Testing
- [ ] Validate secure communication via HTTPS/TLS.  
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not stored in plain text.  
- [ ] Test app against SQL Injection and XSS via inputs.  
- [ ] Verify session timeout and re-login behavior.  
- [ ] Confirm biometric login (fingerprint, Face ID) works correctly.  
- [ ] Validate "Remember Me" tokens expire properly.  
- [ ] Test role-based access (normal user vs admin).  
- [ ] Ensure app doesn‚Äôt allow rooted/jailbroken devices if restricted.  
- [ ] Verify app logs do not expose sensitive info.  

---

## ‚ö° Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure app startup time (< 3s).  
- [ ] Test memory usage (no memory leaks).  
- [ ] Validate battery consumption under normal usage.  
- [ ] Test CPU usage while performing heavy operations.  
- [ ] Verify app size after installation is within limits.  
- [ ] Test scrolling performance in product listing.  
- [ ] Confirm push notification delivery time.  
- [ ] Stress test with high number of background services.  

---

## üß© Usability Testing
- [ ] Confirm navigation is intuitive and user-friendly.  
- [ ] Verify error messages guide users to fix issues.  
- [ ] Validate accessibility (screen readers, voice-over support).  
- [ ] Ensure touch targets are large enough for tapping.  
- [ ] Test form validations with invalid inputs.  
- [ ] Confirm users can easily recover forgotten password.  
- [ ] Validate consistent gestures across app sections.  
- [ ] Verify empty states have helpful instructions.  

---

## üß™ Regression / Smoke
- [ ] Validate critical flows: login, cart, checkout, payments.  
- [ ] Confirm previous bug fixes remain resolved.  
- [ ] Run smoke tests on new builds before full cycle.  
- [ ] Verify integrations (payment, push notifications, 3rd-party APIs).  

---

## üìå Coverage Achieved
- **Functional**: Authentication, profile, cart, checkout, payments.  
- **UI/UX**: Layout, branding, gestures, usability.  
- **Compatibility**: Devices, OS versions, resolutions.  
- **Network**: Wi-Fi, 4G/5G, offline, interruptions.  
- **Security**: HTTPS, biometrics, session, encryption.  
- **Performance**: Startup time, memory, CPU, battery.  
- **Usability**: Accessibility, navigation, error handling.
