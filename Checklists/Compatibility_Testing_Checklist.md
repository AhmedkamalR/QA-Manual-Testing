# 🌐 Compatibility Testing Checklist (Browsers, Devices, OS)

This checklist ensures the product renders and behaves correctly across different browsers, OS versions, screen sizes and device capabilities.

---

## ✅ Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Define supported browser matrix (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) + versions (latest + 2).  
- [ ] Test critical flows across browsers: login, search, add-to-cart, checkout.  
- [ ] Validate CSS & JS feature support (Flexbox, Grid, ES6) or provide fallbacks.  
- [ ] Check cookie, localStorage, and sessionStorage behavior across browsers.  
- [ ] Test popups, modals, and file uploads in each browser.

## 📱 Mobile Browser & Device Compatibility
- [ ] Test on mobile browsers (Chrome for Android, Safari iOS).  
- [ ] Validate responsive breakpoints, viewport meta tag, and touch interactions.  
- [ ] Test on different pixel ratios and screen densities (mdpi, xhdpi, retina).  
- [ ] Verify behavior on both mobile data (3G/4G/5G) and Wi-Fi.

## 🖥️ OS & Platform Compatibility
- [ ] Test on Windows, macOS, Linux variants (as required).  
- [ ] Validate platform-specific behaviors (file pickers, downloads).  
- [ ] Check integration with platform features (notifications, geolocation).

## 🧩 Third-party & Plugin Compatibility
- [ ] Verify third-party scripts (analytics, chat, payment) work across browsers.  
- [ ] Test browser extensions that may affect behavior (ad blockers) in a limited way.  
- [ ] Validate PDF viewers, camera/microphone access on supported platforms.

## ⚙️ Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Ensure key functionality works with older supported browser versions.  
- [ ] Avoid JS/CSS features without fallbacks that break older browsers.  
- [ ] Maintain compatibility notes in release docs if some older versions deprecated.

## 🧪 Automation & Tooling
- [ ] Use cross-browser automation (Selenium Grid / BrowserStack / Sauce Labs).  
- [ ] Have baseline screenshots for visual regression across browsers.  
- [ ] Automate critical path checks across target browsers & devices.
