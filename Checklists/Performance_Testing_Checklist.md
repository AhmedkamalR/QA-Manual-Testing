# ‚ö° Performance Testing Checklist

This checklist ensures **comprehensive validation of system performance** under various conditions, including **load, stress, scalability, and endurance testing**.  
It helps verify that the system meets **non-functional requirements (NFRs)** and performs reliably under expected and peak workloads.  

---

## ‚úÖ General Performance Preparation
- [ ] Define clear **performance goals** (response time, throughput, concurrency).  
- [ ] Identify **critical business transactions** for testing (e.g., checkout, payment, login).  
- [ ] Determine **expected load** (users, transactions per second).  
- [ ] Finalize **test environments** identical to production.  
- [ ] Prepare **test data** volume to simulate real-world conditions.  
- [ ] Ensure monitoring tools are in place (APM, logs, metrics dashboards).  

---

## üìä Load Testing
- [ ] Validate system behavior under **normal load**.  
- [ ] Test response times for **all critical workflows**.  
- [ ] Measure throughput (requests/sec, transactions/sec).  
- [ ] Verify resource usage (CPU, memory, DB connections).  
- [ ] Check **load balancing** across servers.  
- [ ] Monitor **database query performance** under load.  
- [ ] Validate error handling under high user concurrency.  

---

## üí• Stress Testing
- [ ] Gradually increase load until the system breaks.  
- [ ] Identify **system breaking points** (CPU, DB, or API bottlenecks).  
- [ ] Verify system recovery after stress removal.  
- [ ] Capture **error messages** for user-friendliness under stress.  
- [ ] Ensure **failover mechanisms** trigger correctly.  
- [ ] Check if **logging/alerts** work properly when limits are hit.  

---

## üìà Scalability Testing
- [ ] Measure how performance scales when adding resources (horizontal/vertical scaling).  
- [ ] Test application performance on **different server configurations**.  
- [ ] Validate **auto-scaling rules** in cloud environments.  
- [ ] Check DB performance with **partitioning/sharding** enabled.  
- [ ] Assess caching strategies (Redis, CDN) effectiveness.  

---

## ‚è≥ Endurance (Soak) Testing
- [ ] Run the system under **average load for extended duration** (e.g., 24‚Äì72 hrs).  
- [ ] Monitor memory leaks (RAM consumption over time).  
- [ ] Track **database connection pool** stability.  
- [ ] Validate system logs do not grow uncontrollably.  
- [ ] Check **session timeouts** and auto-refresh under long usage.  
- [ ] Verify performance consistency after prolonged operation.  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Failover
- [ ] Simulate **server crashes** and check recovery time.  
- [ ] Test **network interruptions** during load.  
- [ ] Validate redundancy (backup servers, database replication).  
- [ ] Ensure **no data loss** during recovery.  
- [ ] Verify system maintains **transactional integrity**.  

---

## üìå Value
Having this checklist ensures:  
- System is **stable, scalable, and reliable** under varying conditions.  
- Early detection of **bottlenecks and weak points**.  
- Performance meets **business SLAs** before go-live.  
- Increased confidence in handling **high traffic events** (sales, promotions, seasonal peaks).
