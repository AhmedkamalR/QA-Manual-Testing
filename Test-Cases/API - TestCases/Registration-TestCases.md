## üìå Coverage Achieved

- **Valid Scenarios**: Standard registration, newsletter opt-in, referral codes, max-length fields, OAuth registration, MFA, response performance.  
- **Invalid Scenarios**: Missing/empty fields, invalid format, duplicate accounts, weak/disposable credentials, injection/XSS, oversized uploads, wrong content type, rate limiting.  
- **Edge Scenarios**: Very long inputs, emojis, trimmed values, boundary timing, blacklisted domains, payload limits, race conditions, network/server instability.
