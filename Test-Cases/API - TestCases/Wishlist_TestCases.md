## üìå Coverage Achieved

- **Valid Scenarios**: CRUD operations, multi-device sync, pagination, duplicate handling, response validation.  
- **Invalid Scenarios**: Invalid/missing tokens, bad IDs, unavailable products, malformed payloads, permission violations.  
- **Edge Scenarios**: Volume stress, concurrency, injection attacks, race conditions, server recovery, cache behavior.
