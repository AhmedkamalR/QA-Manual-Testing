## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge / Advanced Test Cases

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Attachments |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Add maximum allowed distinct SKUs (e.g., 100 items) | Cart page remains performant; totals correct | ‚Äì |
| 2 | Add product then change region/currency | Currency and shipping recalc correctly or user warned | ‚Äì |
| 3 | Add item while another user purchases last unit | On checkout, user notified and item removed or quantity adjusted | ‚Äì |
| 4 | Two browser tabs add same item simultaneously | Cart merge logic prevents duplicates or adjusts quantities predictably | ‚Äì |

| 6 | Cart with fractional quantities (if allowed) | UI supports and totals calculate correctly | ‚Äì |
| 7 | Price change mid-session (product price updated) | Policy applied (locked price vs live price) and user notified | ‚Äì |
| 8 | Accessibility: navigate cart using keyboard only | Focus order logical, ARIA attributes present, actions reachable | ‚Äì |
| 9 | Low bandwidth: image lazy-loading & skeletons for cart | Page loads gracefully and actions functional | ‚Äì |
| 10 | Cart persisted between devices after login | Items synced and duplicates de-duplicated per policy | ‚Äì |

## üîí Security & Integrity Tests

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Attachments |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Attempt client-side price override and place order | Server enforces server-side pricing; order uses server price | ‚Äì |
| 2 | Try CSRF attack on cart endpoints (simulate) | CSRF tokens validate and request rejected | ‚Äì |

| 2 | Observe cart badge update latency on slow connection | Updates visible with spinner & consistent state | ‚Äì |
| 3 | Usability: CTAs (Checkout, Continue Shopping) visible and clear on mobile & desktop | Buttons accessible and described | ‚Äì |
| 4 | Visual regressions check (different screen sizes) | Cart layout consistent, no overlap | ‚Äì |

## üìå Coverage Achieved

- **Valid Scenarios**: add/update/remove, variations, coupon/gift card, shipping estimate, persistence, mini-cart behavior, proceed-to-checkout flow.  
- **Invalid Scenarios**: inactive products, exceed stock, invalid coupons, client-side tampering, session/cookie loss handling.  
- **Edge Scenarios**: large carts, cross-tab sync, price change policies, coupon expiry race, fractional qty, accessibility keyboard/ARIA, low-bandwidth behavior.  
- **Security**: CSRF, XSS sanitization, server-side price enforcement, authorization checks.  
- **Performance & UX**: cart badge latency, lazy-loading images, responsive layout, keyboard-only navigation, clear error states.
