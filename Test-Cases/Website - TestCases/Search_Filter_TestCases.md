## ‚úÖ Valid Test Cases

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Attachments |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Attachments |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Submit search with empty input. | Validation message or no results page. | |
| 2 | Enter invalid characters (e.g., "@@@@"). | 0 results with handled error state. | |
| 3 | Apply invalid filter values (min > max price). | System shows no results or validation error. | |
| 4 | Modify search URL with invalid product ID. | 404 page displayed gracefully. | |
| 5 | Clear cookies/session and perform search. | Search still works as expected. | |
| 6 | Apply filters on empty results page. | No products found message displayed. | |
| 7 | Perform search without network (offline). | System shows offline error state. | |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Test Cases

| Step | Action | Expected Result | Attachments |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Enter extremely long keyword (200+ chars). | System trims input and returns valid results or error. | |
| 2 | Enter keyword with emojis (e.g., "üì±Laptop"). | Search handles emojis gracefully. | |

| 4 | Product exists but out of stock. | Product appears with "Out of Stock" label. | |
| 5 | Apply all filters at once (brand + price + rating + category). | Results update correctly. | |
| 6 | Use back/forward browser navigation after applying filters. | Filters and results remain consistent. | |
| 7 | Switch device viewport (desktop ‚Üí mobile) mid-search. | Results and filters adapt responsively. | |
| 8 | Load more results with infinite scroll (if supported). | Results load smoothly without duplicates. | |

- **Edge Scenarios**: Very long keywords, emojis/Unicode, case sensitivity, out-of-stock results, multi-filters, responsive checks, infinite scroll, slow internet.  
- **Security**: SQL injection prevention, sanitized query handling, safe error states.  
- **Performance**: Pagination, infinite scroll, slow network, filter performance under load.  
- **Usability**: Consistent filters, back/forward navigation, responsive layouts, multilingual search accuracy.
