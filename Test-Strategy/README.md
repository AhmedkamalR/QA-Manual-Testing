# Test Planning

This folder contains examples of **Test Plans** that I created to define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities.  

##  Contents
- **Sample Test Plan Document** – A formal plan covering objectives, scope, strategy, entry/exit criteria, and risks.  
- **Sprint Test Plans** – Smaller test plans for sprint-based deliveries.  
- **Test Approach** – Scope, levels of testing, and environments.  
- **Risk Analysis** – Potential risks and mitigation plan.

##  Purpose
The goal of this section is to demonstrate my ability to plan and manage testing efforts effectively, ensuring quality delivery within timelines.
