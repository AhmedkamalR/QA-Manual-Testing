# üìù QA Standards & Guidelines - E-commerce Project

## 1. Objective
To establish uniform standards for test design, execution, and reporting across QA team.

## 2. Test Design Standards
- Use **consistent template** for test cases (Step, Action, Expected, Attachment).  
- Maintain **traceability** to requirements.  
- Include both **positive & negative** scenarios.  
- Cover **functional, security, performance, usability** aspects.

---

## 3. Defect Reporting Standards
- Title: concise, clear, module-based.  
- Severity & Priority must be assigned.  
- Always attach screenshot/logs/steps.  
- Use ‚ÄúExpected vs Actual‚Äù format.  

---

## 4. Coding Standards (for automation)
- Follow **Page Object Model (POM)** for Selenium/Appium.  
- Use proper **naming conventions** (e.g., TC_API_Login_Valid).  
- Ensure tests are **idempotent** (can re-run safely).  

---

## 5. Documentation Guidelines
- Version control via Git.  
- All QA docs in Markdown (`.md`).  
- Keep reports, metrics updated regularly.
