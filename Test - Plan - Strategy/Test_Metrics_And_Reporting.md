# ðŸ“Š Test Metrics & Reporting - E-commerce Project

## 1. Objective
Track testing progress, quality, and product readiness through measurable metrics.

## 2. Test Metrics
- **Test Case Execution**: % executed, passed, failed, blocked.  
- **Defect Density**: Defects per module / KLOC.  
- **Defect Leakage**: % defects found in UAT/Prod vs QA.  
- **Defect Re-open Rate**: % of defects reopened after fix.  
- **Automation Coverage**: % of regression automated.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Avg response time, TPS, peak load.  

## 3. Reporting Frequency
- **Daily**: Test execution progress.  
- **Weekly**: Defect trend, risk updates.  
- **Release-level**: Final Test Summary Report.  

## 4. Sample Dashboard
- Pie chart: Test Execution Status.  
- Line graph: Defect Trends over time.  
- Bar chart: Defects by Severity/Priority.  
- Heatmap: Module-wise defect density.
