## 4. Dependencies
- Dev team delivery of stable build.  
- Environment readiness before execution.  
- Test data preparation on time.  
- Timely bug fixes from dev team.  

---

## 5. Risks to Schedule
- Delayed build delivery.  
- Environment downtime.  
- High defect density.  
- Change requests from business.  

---

## 6. Mitigation Plan
- Parallel test design while dev ongoing.  
- Use automation to reduce regression cycle time.  
- Daily defect triage meetings.  
- Freeze scope before UAT.
