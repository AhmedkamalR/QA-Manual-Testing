# ðŸ§ª Master Test Plan - E-commerce Project

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the **overall test plan** for the E-commerce project.  
It covers test scope, objectives, approach, resources, responsibilities, environment, risks, and schedules.  
The goal is to ensure **high-quality delivery** of the E-commerce platform across **Web, Mobile, and API** layers.

---

## 2. Test Objectives
- Verify that all business requirements are implemented correctly.  
- Validate functional, security, usability, and performance aspects.  
- Ensure consistency across **Web, Mobile, and API** platforms.  
- Identify defects early to reduce production risks.  
- Provide clear metrics and reporting for release readiness.  

---

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope
- Functional testing (Login, Registration, Cart, Checkout, Payment, Orders).  
- API testing (Authentication, Products, Orders, Payment endpoints).  
- Mobile app testing (Android & iOS).  
- Integration with external systems (Payment Gateway, Social Login).  
- Performance & load testing for critical flows (Checkout, Search).  
- Security testing (SQL Injection, XSS, OWASP Top 10).  

### Out-of-Scope
- Hardware compatibility testing.  
- Payment gateway internal logic (covered by vendor).  
- Third-party integrations beyond sandbox validation.  

---

## 4. Test Approach
- **Manual Testing**: Functional, usability, exploratory testing.  
- **Automation Testing**: Regression suite (Web = Selenium, Mobile = Appium, API = Postman/Newman/RestAssured).  
- **Performance Testing**: JMeter/Locust for load & stress scenarios.  
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.  
- **Defect Tracking**: Azure DevOps / Jira.  

---

## 5. Test Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Performed by developers.  
- **Integration Testing**: APIs, payment gateway, and external systems.  
- **System Testing**: End-to-end flows across Web & Mobile.  
- **Regression Testing**: Automated and manual mix before releases.  
- **UAT**: Performed with business stakeholders.  

---

## 6. Test Deliverables
- Test Scenarios & Test Cases (Web, Mobile, API).  
- Test Data & Environment Setup.  
- Test Execution Reports (Daily/Weekly).  
- Defect Reports & Logs.  
- Final Test Summary Report (FTSR).  
- Traceability Matrix.  

---

## 7. Environment Requirements
- **Web**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions).  
- **Mobile**: Android 10+, iOS 14+.  
- **API**: Accessible staging environment with test credentials.  
- **Performance**: Load environment with monitoring enabled.  

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities
- **QA Lead**: Test planning, coordination, reporting.  
- **QA Engineers**: Test case design, execution, defect logging.  
- **Automation Engineers**: Build & maintain automation frameworks.  
- **Developers**: Unit testing, defect fixing.  
- **Product Owner/BA**: Requirement validation.

## 9. Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Unstable test environment | High | Dedicated QA environment with monitoring |
| Delayed requirements | Medium | Early communication & agile iteration |
| High defect leakage | High | Strengthen regression suite + reviews |
| Limited devices for mobile | Medium | Use emulators + cloud device farms |
