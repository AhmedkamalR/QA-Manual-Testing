12. Ensure SQL Injection attempts are blocked.  
13. Ensure XSS payloads in name/email fields are sanitized.  
14. Ensure phone/email OTP is not reused after success.  
15. Validate that concurrent registration attempts with same email/phone are blocked properly.

## ‚ö° Performance & Load Scenarios

1. Register 1000 users simultaneously (stress test).  
2. Register users in peak load conditions (e.g., Black Friday).  
3. Register while API response is slow (simulate network latency).  
4. Register while internet disconnects & reconnects mid-process.  
5. Validate system behavior under heavy OTP SMS/email traffic.  
6. Validate registration with large concurrent requests does not crash DB.  
7. Measure response time for registration API under 100 TPS (transactions/sec).  
8. Ensure registration form loads within acceptable time (<2 sec) on Web.  
9. Ensure registration flow completes within <5 sec on Mobile (normal conditions).  
10. Test registration on low-end mobile devices with limited memory.  
11. Test registration on slow 3G/edge network.  
12. Validate system recovers after sudden server restart during registration load.

üìå **Coverage Achieved**  
- **Positive**: Full valid registration flow including email, phone, OTP, social logins, profile upload, localization.  
- **Negative**: Invalid inputs, duplicate accounts, missing fields, weak passwords, expired OTP, API failures, injection attacks.  
- **Edge**: Maximum input lengths, special chars, emojis, large uploads, concurrency, device orientation, locale variations.  
- **Security**: HTTPS, password hashing, brute-force protection, CSRF, SQLi/XSS, OTP security.  
- **Performance**: Load, stress, latency, concurrency, device/network variations.
