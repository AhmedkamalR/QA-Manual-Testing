# Exploratory Testing Notes

This folder contains **real session notes** from exploratory testing activities.  
Exploratory testing helps discover hidden defects, usability issues, and unexpected behaviors by exploring the system without pre-defined scripts.

##  Contents
- **Session Notes** – Detailed notes taken during exploratory testing sessions.  
- **Mind Maps** – Visual representation of test ideas and flows.  
- **Defect Discovery** – Issues found during ad-hoc and exploratory sessions.  

##  Purpose
To demonstrate my ability to test creatively, beyond scripted test cases, and identify edge cases and usability gaps quickly.
