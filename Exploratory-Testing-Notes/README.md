# 🕵️ Exploratory Testing Notes

This folder contains **professional exploratory testing documentation** for the E-commerce project.  
Exploratory testing focuses on **simultaneous learning, test design, and execution** to uncover issues that scripted test cases might miss.  

---

## 📂 Contents
- **Session Notes** – Detailed notes taken during exploratory testing sessions (Web, Mobile, API).  
- **Mind Maps** – Visual representation of test ideas and flows for quick exploration.  
- **Defect Discovery** – Issues found during ad-hoc and exploratory sessions.  
- **Session-Based Testing** – Structured charters and time-boxed testing approaches.  
- **Bug Tours Checklist** – Exploratory tours (e.g., feature tour, error tour, scenario tour) to uncover hidden issues.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to:  
- Document **exploratory findings** across Web, Mobile, and API platforms.  
- Capture **test charters, observations, and risks** during sessions.  
- Highlight defects that scripted testing may miss.  
- Encourage **creative and risk-based testing approaches**.  

---

## 📌 Value
Maintaining exploratory notes ensures:  
- **Traceability** of exploratory sessions and findings.  
- **Increased coverage** through ad-hoc and unscripted tests.  
- **Better defect discovery**, especially edge and usability issues.  
- **Knowledge sharing** among QA team members.

## 🧭 Example Session Structure
Each exploratory session should capture:  
1. **Charter** – What to test and the scope of exploration.  
2. **Time-box** – Fixed session duration (e.g., 60–90 mins).  
3. **Environment** – Web, Mobile, or API under test.  
4. **Notes & Observations** – Steps tried, unexpected behaviors, usability gaps.  
5. **Defects** – Bugs logged during the session.  
6. **Follow-ups** – Areas needing deeper scripted or regression tests.
